# Loan Status Prediction - Machine Learning Model Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

This project focuses on the development and evaluation of a machine learning model for predicting loan status. The model uses various features, including loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, and total debt, to classify loan applications. The primary objectives of this analysis aim to assess the model's performance in predicting loan status and also, evaluate the impact of resampling techniques on the model performance.

## Results

### Original Model

- **Accuracy Score**: 0.99
- **Precision Score**: 0.85
- **Recall Score**: 0.91

### Resampled Model

- **Accuracy Score**: 0.99
- **Precision Score**: 0.85
- **Recall Score**: 0.91

Both the original and resampled models exhibit nearly identical performance metrics, with high accuracy, precision, and recall scores.

## Summary

Both the original and resampled models demonstrate exceptional predictive capabilities. However, based on the evaluation, it is recommended to use the original machine learning model for predicting loan status within the company. This model's high accuracy, precision, and recall scores make it a valuable tool for automating loan approval processes and assessing credit risk.

The justification for this recommendation is that the original model performs exceptionally well and does not require additional steps for resampling. It provides reliable results for loan classification.

In conclusion, the machine learning model, whether in its original form or after resampling, is well-suited for enhancing the loan approval process and effectively managing credit risk. Continuous monitoring and updates are advised to maintain model accuracy and alignment with evolving lending criteria and market dynamics.
